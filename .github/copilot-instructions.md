# ✅ **Clinical Decision Support System - Project Completed Successfully!**

This is a **Preliminary Disease Prediction and Clinical Decision Support** system with comprehensive AI/ML capabilities.

## **Technology Stack Analysis:**
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI 0.104.1 with Python 3.11
- **AI/ML Tools**: PyTorch 2.1.0, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (Production) / SQLite (Development) 
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0.23 with Alembic migrations
- **Validation**: Pydantic 2.5.0 schemas
- **Testing**: pytest with comprehensive API tests
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization with docker-compose

## **Database Schema & Connection:**
**Development Connection**: `sqlite:///./pdpcds_dev.db`
**Production Connection**: `postgresql://pdpcds_user:pdpcds_password@postgres:5432/pdpcds_db`

**Core Tables:**
1. **predictions** - ML predictions and patient data
2. **icd10_codes** - Disease diagnosis codes reference  
3. **medical_tests** - Diagnostic test recommendations
4. **medications** - Drug information and recommendations
5. **patients** - Patient information (optional tracking)

## **AI/ML Model Architecture:**
- **Multi-task PyTorch Neural Network**
- **Input Features**: 150-dimensional vector (vitals + symptoms + medical history + text)
- **Tasks**: Disease classification, test recommendation, medication suggestion
- **Architecture**: Shared encoder (512→512→256) + 4 task-specific heads
- **Output**: Top 3 disease predictions with ICD-10 codes and confidence scores

## **API Endpoints:**
- **Base URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- **Disease Prediction**: POST `/api/v1/predict/`
- **Health Check**: GET `/health` 
- **Interactive Documentation**: GET `/docs`
- **Alternative Documentation**: GET `/redoc`

## **Project Features:**
✅ **Complete FastAPI backend** with CORS, validation, error handling
✅ **Multi-task PyTorch model** for disease prediction
✅ **Comprehensive database models** with proper relationships  
✅ **ICD-10 code mapping** with medical terminology
✅ **Test & medication recommendations** with confidence scoring
✅ **Docker deployment setup** for production scaling
✅ **API documentation** with Swagger UI
✅ **Comprehensive technical documentation**

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND DEPLOYABLE**
